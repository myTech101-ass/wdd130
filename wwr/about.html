                    <p>We go rafting every 1-2 years and we ALWAYS go with All-Outdoors. 
                        A great family owned company, AMAZING food on the river, 
                        knowledgeable and fun guides, and an all around fantastic experience. 
                        It is easy to tell that All-Outdoors groups have more fun, 
                        get better food, and have a safer experience."</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>More than 60 years of rafting on California rivers is enough time to 
                        experience anything that can happen on a whitewater rafting trip.
                        Organizing over 40,000 trips is the best way to learn how to put on 
                        amazing rafting adventures! Taking 450,000 guests down rivers is a 
                        great way to learn how to care for folks as you lead them through river canyons.
                        Experience is a good teacher and All-Outdoors has more of it than any 
                        other California outfitter</p>
